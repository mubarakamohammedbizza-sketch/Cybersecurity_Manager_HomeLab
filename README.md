##  Overview  
This project simulates the responsibilities of a **Cybersecurity Manager**, demonstrating practical skills in **security monitoring, vulnerability management, automation, and compliance reporting**.  
It integrates tools and concepts from **Cisco, Microsoft, and Linux** environments to emulate a real enterprise security operation.  

---

##  Objectives  
- Implement and monitor enterprise-level network security controls.  
- Conduct incident response, risk analysis, and vulnerability management.  
- Automate repetitive SOC workflows using scripting.  
- Align practices with **NIST CSF** and **ISO 27001** standards.  
- Deliver executive-style reporting and documentation.

##  Key Phases  

### **Phase 1: Network Setup & Hardening**  
- Designed a 3-tier VLAN network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer.  
- Configured Ubuntu and Windows 10 endpoints for log forwarding to Splunk.  
- Applied firewall rules and user permissions for access segmentation.  

### **Phase 2: Threat Detection & Incident Response**  
- Simulated brute-force attacks with Kali Linux and captured packets in Wireshark.  
- Detected and analyzed alerts in Splunk and Security Onion.  
- Created structured incident response documentation based on NIST 800-61.  

### **Phase 3: Vulnerability Management**  
- Performed recurring Nessus scans for Linux and Windows systems.  
- Automated CSV parsing using Python to extract high-risk vulnerabilities.  
- Built Excel dashboard visualizing remediation progress.  

### **Phase 4: Identity & Access Management**  
- Configured Active Directory (AD) roles and enforced MFA via Azure AD.  
- Used PowerShell scripts for bulk account creation and audit reporting.  
- Monitored user access logs using Splunk queries and alerts.  

### **Phase 5: Automation & Compliance Reporting**  
- Automated daily security report generation using Python.  
- Mapped controls to NIST CSF categories and visualized results in PowerPoint.  
- Presented findings as a simulated CISO-level summary.
